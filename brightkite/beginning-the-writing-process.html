					<div class="text-page-content">

					<p><b>Be prepared, writing takes time</b></p>

					<p>Start with a composition! Learn when the homework is due and formulate a <u>plan of action.</u> Writing is an entire process, not just a finished product. Even the best professional writers start with compositions, they do not simply sit down at a computer, and call it a day. The quality of your writing will reveal the time and forethought you place into the homework, whcih is a reflection of you as a student. Plan for the homework by doing prewriting (composing): this will let you be organized and more productive when you sit down to start composing your paper. Additionally, program several blocks of time to dedicate to your writing; afterward, you can walk away from it for some time and come back afterwards to make revisions and changes with a new head.</p>
					<p></p>

					<p><b>Use this process to think through your writing before you actually start</b></p>

					<p>Thinking about your homework when it comes to your rhetorical school work can help direct you in the beginning of the writing procedure. The writer, subject, audience, genre, style, argument, research, and intent are just a couple of components that will make up your rhetorical situation.</p>

					<p>Audience and subject are frequently quite intertwined and work to educate each other. Begin with a comprehensive perspective of your subject; like global warming, politics, or The Great Gatsby and then make an effort to concentrate or refine your subject into a concise a thesis statement by thinking about your audience and what they would react to. Here are a few questions you'll be able to ask yourself about crowd:</p>

					<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>Who's your audience?</li>
					<li>Do you believe your audience is interested in this issue? Why or why not?</li>
					<li>Why should your audience be interested in this subject?</li>
					<li>What does your audience already know about this issue?</li>
					<li>What does your audience should understand relating to this issue?</li>
					<li>What experiences has your crowd had that would affect them on this issue?</li>
					<li>What do you expect the audience will gain from your text?</li>
					</ul>

					<p>By way of example, imagine your comprehensive subject is poverty. Who's your audience? You might be writing to volunteers at a homeless shelter, people who just lost their jobs, students, politicians, or travelers among others. Each of these groups would have different experiences with and interests in the subject of poverty. While pupils might be more concerned with the someone who just lost their job might be concerned with ways to avoid it, volunteers at a homeless shelter will be concerned with ways to solve it.</p>

					<p>You can even consider chance as a means to refine or focus your topic by asking yourself what current events make your subject important right now. As an example, you could join the present discussion about the next political election and their stance on poverty or you could link the growing cost of housing as an external factor to homelessness.</p>


					<p><b>Never forget the purpose you are writing for</b></p>

					<p>Writing can have a variety of functions. Here are just a couple of examples:</p>

					<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li><b>Summarizing:</b> Presenting essence or the principal purposes of another text in a condensed form.</li>

					<li><b>Claiming/Getting:</b> Expressing a view on an issue or theme in an attempt to convince others your point of view is right.</li>

					<li><b>Narrating:</b> Telling a story or giving an account of occasions.</li>

					<li><b>Appraising:</b> In order to ascertain its value or worth analyzing something based on a set of standards.</li>

					<li><b>Examining:</b> In order to analyze the connections between the parts breaking a subject down into its component parts.</li>

					<li><b>Answering:</b> Composing that's in an immediate dialogue with another text.</li>

					<li><b>Analyzing/Investigating:</b> Methodically questioning a matter uncover or to detect facts which aren't widely understood or
					   accepted, in a way that strives to be impartial and objective as possible.</li>

					<li><b>Finding:</b> Helping the reader comprehend and see a person, place, thing, picture or occasion which you experienced or have observed through in-depth sensory descriptions.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You may use several of these writing strategies within your paper, if not all of them. For example you could summarize Hilary Clinton’s stance on poverty, assess whether those guidelines are fit to your beliefs, and after that claim what types of changes need to occur to prevent poverty in the United States.</p>


					<p><b>Always start with your thesis</b></p>

					<p>Do not begin writing until after you have formed thesis statement! Do not feel constrained by format problems. Do not worry about spelling, grammar, or writing in complete sentences. Brainstorm and write down everything you can think of that might link to the thesis after which you can re-read and value the ideas you created. It is simpler to cut out bad thoughts than to just think of great ones. You'll be able to use a basic outline construction to start to take into consideration organization once you've a smattering of useful methods to approach the thesis. Remember to be adaptable; this is simply a means to get you writing. Do not be scared to refine your initial thoughts, if better thoughts happen to you as you are writing.</p>
