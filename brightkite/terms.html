					<p><span>21. Procedures for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement</span></p>

					<p><span>We are committed to complying with U.S. Copyright and related laws. Our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the &quot;DMCA&quot;), the pertinent portion, which you can review by clicking here. It is our policy to (1) block access or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users; and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied and is accessible on our Service in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify us by providing our copyright agent with the following information in accordance with the requirements of the DMCA:</span></p>

					<p><span>The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or the person authorized to act on the owner&#39;s behalf.</span><br>
					<span>A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed and a description of the infringing activity.</span><br>
					<span>Identification of the location where the original or an authorized copy of the copyrighted work exists, for example the URL of the website where it is posted or the name of the book in which it has been published.</span>
					<br>
					<span>Identification of the URL or other specific location on this Service where the material that you claim is infringing is located; you must include enough information to allow us to locate the material.</span><br>
					<span>Your name, address, telephone number, and email address so that we may contact you.</span><br>
					<span>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</span><br>
					<span>A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner&#39;s behalf.</span><br>
					<span>Our agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement on this Service can be reached as follows:</span></p>

					<p><span>By email:</span></p>

					<p><span>{site email}</span></p>

					<p><span>If you believe that an account holder or subscriber is a repeat infringer, please follow the instructions above to contact our DMCA agent identified above and provide information sufficient for us to verify that the account holder or subscriber is a repeat infringer.</span></p>

					<p><span>If you receive a notification of alleged infringement as described above, and you believe in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then you may send a counter notification to the email address listed above. Upon our receipt of a counter notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, we will provide a copy of the counter notification to the person who sent the original notification of claimed infringement and will follow the DMCA&#39;s procedures regarding counter notification. All counter notifications must satisfy the requirements of Section 512(g)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act. In all events, you expressly agree that we will not be a party to any disputes or lawsuits regarding alleged copyright infringement.</span></p>

					<p><span>Please note that you may be held liable for money damages if you materially misrepresent that an activity is infringing your copyrights. This contact information is only for reporting copyright infringement. Please see the Questions and Contact Information section for contact information for other topics.</span></p>

					<p><span>22. Dispute Resolution</span></p>

					<p><span>For any dispute that you have with us, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address in Section 23 below. We each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. If we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive this claim description, you may pursue your claim in arbitration as described below.</span></p>

					<p><span>23. Arbitration</span></p>

					<p><span>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT OR OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. We each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. THE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS&#39; FEES). THIS PROVISION APPLIES TO ANY USER WHO REGISTERS FOR ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON OR AFTER APRIL 10, 2012.</span></p>
					<p><span>If the arbitration provision applies or you choose arbitration to resolve your disputes, then either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. You must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent to begin arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will arbitrate all disputes. For claims of less than $75,000, the AAA&#39;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for claims over $75,000, the AAA&#39;s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims that total less than $75,000. For claims that total more than $75,000, the payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.</span></p>
					<p><span>An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys&#39; fees. In addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and costs.</span></p>
					<p><span>CLASS ACTION WAIVER. WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR AS A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If you choose to pursue your claim in court by opting out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</span></p>
					<p><span>JURY TRIAL WAIVER. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</span></p>

					<p><span>24. Questions and Contact Information</span></p>
